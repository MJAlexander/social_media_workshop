# Welcome!

This website contains links to materials for a 2-hour 'Social Media Workshop for Population Research' workshop for [CAnD3 Fellows](https://www.mcgill.ca/cand3/) run in April 2021. The workshop provides R code examples of extracting, manipulating and analyzing Twitter data. You can also find all the code and related materials in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/MJAlexander/social_media_workshop). 

Below is a summary of all the modules we will aim to cover in the workshop. 

# Set-up

This section covers what you will need to do before the workshop. Please make sure you have read through these instructions and materials before the workshop. 

## Twitter accounts

You need a Twitter account! 

## Set up code

We will be using a lot of different packages, so before the workshop begins it would be great if you can make sure everything is installed and working. 

This R script covers the main things you need: [0_setup.R](https://github.com/MJAlexander/social_media_workshop/blob/main/code/0_setup.R).

Please try and run this before the workshop to make sure everything is working. 

## Revision of the tidyverse and `ggplot`
