# Welcome!

This website contains links to materials for a 2-hour 'Social Media Workshop for Population Research' workshop for [CAnD3 Fellows](https://www.mcgill.ca/cand3/) run in April 2021. The workshop provides R code examples of extracting, manipulating and analyzing Twitter data. You can also find all the code and related materials in the GitHub repo linked above. 

Below is a summary of all the modules we will aim to cover in the workshop. 

# Set-up

## Twitter accounts

You need a Twitter account! 

## Set up code
We will be using a lot of packages, so before the workshop begins it would be great if you can make sure everything is installed and working. 

There is a intro R script [here](https://github.com/MJAlexander/social_media_workshop/blob/main/code/0_setup.R) which covers the main things you need. Please try and run this before the workshop to make sure everything is working.
