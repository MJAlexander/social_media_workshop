# Motivation

# Motivation

--

- With the rise of social media comes the rise of data

--

- Data about people

    + characteristics, movements, connections, interests, views...
--

- Potentially rich data sources for population research
--

- Strengths that traditional data sources often don't have

    + timely
    
    + large sample sizes
    
    + granular information
--

- But potential drawbacks as well (more later)

# Types and uses of social media data
---

# Types of social media data

--

### By platform

--

- Twitter 

--

- Facebook

--

- LinkedIn

--

- Instagram, TikTok...

--

- Springer, Google Scholar, arXiv

---

# Types of social media data

--

### By data collected

--

- Population data from advertising platforms

    + aggregate level population estimates by subgroup
    + useful in demographic estimation
    + e.g. [Estimating out-migration from Puerto Rico](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/padr.12289)

--

- Individual digital trace data

    + Individual profiles, friends and behavior
    + Text / media data, networks
    + Use to study networks, information spread, opinions, etc
    + e.g. [Assessing the Russian Internet Research Agencyâ€™s impact on the political attitudes and behaviors of American Twitter users in late 2017](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/117/1/243.full.pdf)
    + e.g. [Geography of Twitter networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378873311000359?casa_token=_ihyPFLiN3wAAAAA:wlhmucP0-sdp_vwynl23QWEPWjNdj0w1lVAgzA8UjOQzcArTguH2BFt48MVXQc3Vkc-K3cui7Ws)

# Types of social media data

### By data collected
    
--

- Survey data

    + Use social media platforms to reach and survey people
    + Timely, hard-to-reach populations, cheap?
    + e.g. [Behaviours and attitudes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic: insights from a cross-national Facebook survey](https://epjdatascience.springeropen.com/articles/10.1140/epjds/s13688-021-00270-1)

--

- Detailed user data

    + Know everything about your userbase
    + Probably only when you work at these places
    + e.g. [Measuring Long-Term Displacement Using Facebook Data](https://research.fb.com/publications/measuring-long-term-displacement-using-facebook-data/)
    + e.g. [Country Differences in Social Comparison on Social Media](https://research.fb.com/publications/country-differences-in-social-comparison-on-social-media/)

# How do we get it

---

# How do we get it

--

### Manually?

- I guess you could copy paste info you view on a social media webpage
- Slow, hard, not reproducible

--

### Webscraping

- Write code that visit a webpage and extracts data
- More automated and reproducible, but often not best practice
- Legality and ethical considerations depend on the specifics of what you're doing
- Some good tips and principles are [here](https://www.tellingstorieswithdata.com/gather-data.html#scraping).

---
# How do we get it

--

### Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)

--

- A tool that makes it easier for a computer to query a website's data
- Most social media websites have APIs, that let you programmatically query and extract data
- e.g. [Facebook marketing API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-apis/)
- [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)
- e.g. [arXiv API](https://arxiv.org/help/api/)

--

### R packages that help to query APIs

--

- Many pacakges exist to help R users query APIs
- We will be using two: `rtweet` and `tidygeocoder`
- Others e.g. `rfacebookstat`, `Rlinkedin`, `scholar`...

# Issues and what we don't know

---

# Non-representativeness

--

- As population researchers, we are generally interested in studying phenomena in the broader population (or specific subgroups of the broader population)

- But in general, people who use social media are not at all representative of the broader population

--
- How do we adjust for this?

    + some examples in the demographic estimation realm. Can use a 'gold standard' data source to estimate and adjust for biases
    + e.g. see [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11113-020-09599-3) and [here](https://www.demogr.mpg.de/papers/working/wp-2020-019.pdf)
    + but harder to think about in other realms. How do we generalize networks, or opinions/behavior seen online?

- If we can only infer based on the population for which we have data for, how useful is it?
---

# Self-reporting and other biases
--

- A lot of information is self-reported

- e.g. self-reported locations, public bio information

- No demographic information is available on Twitter

    + past efforts have imputed based on e.g. profile pictures, names
    + error prone, may be inflating bias

- How do we check for biases? 

- How do we make sure analyses are robust to assumptions?

--

# This workshop

---

# What it is and what it isn't
--

### What we will be doing 

- A brief introduction to how get extract and work with Twitter data

- Introduction to not only querying APIs, but also **geocoding**, **mapping**, and **text analysis**

- Useful skills and code to take with you and think about how to apply in your own research

--

### But think about

- How can I draw inferences about the population I'm interested in?

- How can I check the robustness of my analysis?

- How can I make my research open and reproducible?


---

# Plan for the rest of the workshop

--

- Run through the three modules

--

- Assuming you've installed everything and gone through the `set_up` R code, which checks to see if everything works

--

- I will share my screen and go through the code in the R Markdown files

--

- Any questions / comments put in chat 


---
